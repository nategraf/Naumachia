      Arthur: Now, we are about to attempt to cross...the Bridge of Death!  The
              gate-keeper of the Bridge will ask any who attempt to cross five 
              questions---Sir Bedevere: Three, sire.

      Arthur: Oh, yes, three. He who successfully answers these five 
              questions-- 

    Bedevere: Three, sire!

      Arthur: Ah, three, then...er, may pass in safety.
              However, anyone who fails to correctly answer all five questions- 

    Bedevere: THREE, sire!

      Arthur: I KNOW IT'S BLOODY THR--ahem, yes, of course, three. 
              ...will be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril!!!


 
      Arthur: Sir Robin, why don't you go?

       Robin: Er...
              I've got an idea! Why doesn't Sir Lancelot go?

    Lancelot: Yes, I'll take him, sire. (about to draw sword) I'll make a
              feint to the North-East, and then-- 

      Arthur: No, no, just answer the questions, Sir Lancelot.

    Lancelot: But I'd really like a feint to the North-East, sire...

      Arthur: No, Sir Lancelot. We'll all be right behind you, listening...

    Lancelot: I...
              understand, sire.

      Arthur: Our prayers go with you, Sir Lancelot.
